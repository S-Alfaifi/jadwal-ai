# Jadwal.Ai – Smart University Schedule Generator

Jadwal.Ai is a simple web app that helps university students automatically generate conflict-free class schedules. Instead of manually comparing sections, times, and exam dates, the app calculates all valid schedule combinations in seconds and shows the best options.

## 📌 Project Idea

The goal of this project is to make the process of building a university schedule easier and faster.  
Students can:

1. Add their courses  
2. Add sections for each course (lecture/lab)  
3. Enable or disable specific sections  
4. Generate schedules automatically  

The system checks for:

- **Time conflicts** between classes  
- **Final exam conflicts**  
- **Overlapping sections**

If everything is valid, the app displays all possible schedules that the student can select from.
